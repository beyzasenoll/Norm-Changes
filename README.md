# **Norm Change Through Multi-Agent Systems Approach**  

## **Overview**  
This research project explores **norm change using the multi-agent systems approach**, focusing on how norms emerge, persist, and evolve within agent-based models. Social norms regulate collective behavior, and understanding their transformation is crucial for various domains, including policy-making, artificial intelligence ethics, and organizational dynamics.  

## **Objective**  
The study aims to **simulate and analyze the mechanisms driving norm change**, considering factors such as agent interactions, learning dynamics, and external influences. By leveraging multi-agent systems, it investigates how individual agents influence collective norms and how these norms shift over time.  

## **Methodology**  
The project employs various computational and analytical methods, including:  
- **Agent-Based Modeling:** Simulating agent interactions to observe norm evolution.  
- **Game Theory:** Analyzing strategic decision-making in norm compliance and deviation.  
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Studying how agents adapt to changing norms over time.  

## **Applications**  
Understanding norm change through multi-agent systems has implications in:  
- **Social and Policy Studies:** Designing interventions to promote positive behavioral shifts.  
- **Artificial Intelligence and Ethics:** Ensuring AI systems adhere to evolving ethical norms.  
- **Organizational Behavior:** Examining how institutions and companies adapt to norm changes.  

This project contributes to the broader understanding of how norms evolve in complex systems and how computational approaches can be used to model and influence these changes.
